Chipping, breaking or cracking a tooth is usually not serious. A dentist should be able to treat it.

Non-urgent advice:
See a dentist if you or your child has:
chipped, cracked or broken a tooth
If a piece of tooth has broken off, put it in milk or saliva (by spitting into a container if it's your tooth, or having your child spit into a container if it's theirs) and take it to a dentist. The dentist may be able to glue the piece of tooth back on.
Do not go to a GP. They will not be able to give you dental treatment.

Information:
