Treatment for corns and calluses
A GP can check if you have a corn or callus.
They might:
give you antibiotics if a corn or callus is infected
refer you to a foot specialist if they think you need further treatment
Treatment from a foot specialist
A foot specialist, such as a podiatrist, may be able to offer treatments such as:
cutting away the corn or callus
patches to help soften the hard skin so it can be removed
specially made soft pads or insoles to take pressure off the painful area of your foot
Referral to a podiatrist on the NHS may not be available to everyone and waiting times can be long. You can pay to see a podiatrist privately.
