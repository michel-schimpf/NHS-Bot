It's common to have ovulation pain about 14 days before your period. It usually lasts a short time and is nothing to worry about.

Check if it's ovulation pain
Some women get ovulation pain.
It can affect anyone who ovulates, which is when an egg is released as part of your menstrual cycle.
Ovulation pain often:
feels like a dull pain or sharp sudden twinges
lasts from a few minutes to 1 or 2 days
happens about 14 days before a period
only affects 1 side of your tummy at a time
switches sides each time, depending on which ovary releases an egg
You may also have a little vaginal bleeding or discharge during ovulation.

Causes of ovulation pain
Ovulation pain is caused by the ovary releasing the egg.
There are some conditions that may cause a similar pain.
These include:
conditions that affect the womb or ovaries such as
endometriosis
and
ovarian cysts
some sexually transmitted infections (STIs), such as
chlamydia
scar tissue (adhesions) from surgery you've had near the ovaries, such as a
caesarean section
an
ectopic pregnancy

Urgent advice:
Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if:
You have tummy pain and:
the pain is severe and painkillers have not helped
the pain keeps coming back
you think you may be pregnant
You can call 111 or

Treatment for ovulation pain
If ovulation is the only cause of your pain and it's not severe, a warm bath or painkillers, such as
paracetamol
or
ibuprofen
may be all you need.
A GP may advise
contraception
to stop you from ovulating, such as the contraceptive pill or a contraceptive implant.
If a GP thinks something else is causing the pain, they may refer you for tests or to see a specialist. Treatment will depend on what the cause is.
