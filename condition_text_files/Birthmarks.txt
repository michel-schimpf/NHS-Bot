Birthmarks are coloured marks on the skin that are present at birth or soon afterwards. Most are harmless and disappear without treatment, but some may need to be treated.

Congenital moles:
are brown or black moles caused by an overgrowth of pigment cells in the skin
look darker on brown or black skin
can become darker, raised and hairy, particularly during puberty
may develop into skin cancer if they're large (the risk increases the larger they are)
do not need to be treated unless there's a risk of skin cancer

Non-urgent advice:
See a GP if:
you're worried about a birthmark
a birthmark is close to the eye, nose, or mouth
a birthmark has got bigger, darker or lumpier
a birthmark is sore or painful
your child has 6 or more cafe-au-lait spots
you or your child has a large congenital mole
The GP may ask you to check the birthmark for changes, or they may refer you to a skin specialist (dermatologist).

Treatment for birthmarks
Most birthmarks do not need treatment, but some do. This is why it's important to get a birthmark checked if you're worried about it.
A birthmark can be removed on the NHS if it's affecting a person's health. If you want a birthmark removed for cosmetic reasons, you'll have to pay to have it done privately.
Possible treatments for birthmarks include:
medicines – to reduce blood flow to the birthmark, which can slow down its growth and make it lighter in colour
laser therapy – where heat and light are used to make the birthmark smaller and lighter (it works best if started between 6 months and 1 year of age)
surgery – to remove the birthmark (but it can leave scarring)
