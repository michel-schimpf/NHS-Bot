Diarrhoea and vomiting are common in adults, children and babies. They're often caused by a stomach bug and should stop in a few days.
The advice is the same if you have diarrhoea and vomiting together or separately.

How to treat diarrhoea and vomiting yourself
You can usually treat yourself or your child at home. The most important thing is to have lots of fluids to avoid dehydration.
Do
stay at home and get plenty of rest
drink lots of fluids, such as water or squash – take small sips if you feel sick
carry on breast or bottle feeding your baby – if they're being sick, try giving small feeds more often than usual
give babies on formula or solid foods small sips of water between feeds
eat when you feel able to – you do not need to eat or avoid any specific foods
take
paracetamol
if you're in discomfort – check the leaflet before giving it to your child
Don’t
do not have fruit juice or fizzy drinks – they can make diarrhoea worse
do not make baby formula weaker – use it at its usual strength
do not give children under 12 medicine to stop diarrhoea
do not give aspirin to children under 16

How long diarrhoea and vomiting last
In adults and children:
diarrhoea usually stops within 5 to 7 days
vomiting usually stops in 1 or 2 days

Diarrhoea and vomiting can spread easily
Important
Stay off school or work until you've not been sick or had diarrhoea for at least 2 days.
If you also have a high temperature or do not feel well enough to do your normal activities, try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people until you feel better.
To help avoid spreading an infection:
Do
wash your hands
with soap and water frequently
wash any clothing or bedding that has poo or vomit on it separately on a hot wash
clean toilet seats, flush handles, taps, surfaces and door handles every day
Don’t
do not prepare food for other people, if possible
do not share towels, flannels, cutlery or utensils
do not use a swimming pool until 2 weeks after the symptoms stop

A pharmacist can help with diarrhoea and vomiting

dehydration
– such as dark, smelly pee or peeing less than usual
you're an older person, have a weakened immune system or have other health conditions that put you at increased risk of dehydration
you need to stop diarrhoea for a few hours
They may recommend:
oral rehydration sachets you mix with water to make a drink
