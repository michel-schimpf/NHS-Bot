Lumps can appear anywhere on your body. Most lumps are harmless but it's important to see a GP if you're worried or the lump is still there after 2 weeks.

Most lumps are normal
Most people get lumps and growths on their skin at some point. They can be caused by many things.
They can:
be soft or hard to touch
move around
be the size of a pea or a golf ball
be a lump under the skin or a growth that hangs off your skin

Non-urgent advice:
See a GP if:
your lump gets bigger
your lump is painful, red or hot
your lump is hard and does not move
your lump lasts more than 2 weeks
a lump grows back after it's been removed
you have a lump in the breast or testicles
you have a swelling on the side of your neck, armpit or groin that does not go down

What happens at your appointment
The GP will look at your lump. They may be able to tell you what's causing it.
If they're unsure, they might refer you to hospital for tests, such as a
biopsy
(where a very small sample of the lump is removed and tested) or an
ultrasound scan
.
