Shingles is an infection that causes a painful rash. Get advice from 111 as soon as possible if you think you have it.

Check if you have shingles
The first signs of shingles can be:
a tingling or painful feeling in an area of skin
a headache or feeling generally unwell
A rash will appear a few days later.
Usually you get the shingles rash on your chest and tummy, but it can appear anywhere on your body including on your face, eyes and genitals.
The rash appears as blotches on your skin, on 1 side of your body only. A rash on both the left and right of your body is unlikely to be shingles.
The blotches become itchy blisters that ooze fluid. A few days later, the blisters dry out and scab.

How to treat shingles symptoms yourself
Do
take
paracetamol
to ease pain
keep the rash clean and dry to reduce the risk of infection
wear loose-fitting clothing
use a cool compress (a bag of frozen vegetables wrapped in a towel or a wet cloth) a few times a day
Don’t
do not let dressings or plasters stick to the rash
do not use antibiotic cream – this slows healing

How long shingles lasts
It can take up to 4 weeks for the rash to heal.
Your skin can be painful for weeks after the rash has gone, but it usually gets better over time.

Stay away from certain groups of people if you have shingles
You cannot spread shingles to others. But people who have not had chickenpox before could catch chickenpox from you.
This is because shingles is caused by the chickenpox virus.
Try to avoid:
pregnant people who have not had chickenpox before
people with a weakened immune system – like someone having chemotherapy
babies less than 1 month old – unless you gave birth to them, as your baby should be protected from the virus by your immune system
Important:
Work and school
Stay off work or school if the rash is still oozing fluid (weeping) and cannot be covered, or until the rash has dried out.
You can only spread the infection to other people while the rash oozes fluid.
You can cover the rash with loose clothing or a non-sticky dressing.

Shingles and pregnancy
If you're pregnant and get shingles, there's no danger to your pregnancy or baby.
But you should be referred to a specialist, as you may need antiviral treatment.

You cannot get shingles from someone with chickenpox
You cannot get shingles from someone with shingles or chickenpox.
But you can get chickenpox from someone with shingles if you have not had chickenpox before.
When people get chickenpox, the virus remains in the body. It can be reactivated later and cause shingles if someone's immune system is lowered.
This can be because of stress, certain conditions, or treatments like chemotherapy.

Shingles vaccination
A shingles vaccine is available on the NHS for:
people who turned 65 on or after 1 September 2023
people aged 70 to 79
people aged 50 and over with a severely weakened immune system
The vaccine helps reduce your risk of getting shingles.
If you get shingles after being vaccinated, the symptoms can be much milder.
Ask your GP surgery if you can get the vaccine on the NHS.
