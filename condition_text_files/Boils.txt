Things you can do to help boils
There are things you can do to treat boils yourself and stop them coming back.
Do
soak a clean cloth in warm water and hold it against the boil for 10 minutes 4 times a day
clean the area around the boil with antibacterial soap if pus comes out
cover the area with a dressing or gauze until it heals
bathe or shower every day and wash your hands regularly
take
paracetamol
or
ibuprofen
to ease the pain
wash your towels and bedding at least once a week at high temperature
try to lose weight if you are very overweight and have boils between folds of your skin
Don’t
do not pick, squeeze or pierce a boil
do not share your towel with other people until the boil has gone
do not go to a swimming pool or gym until the boil has gone –⁠ you could pass the infection on to others
