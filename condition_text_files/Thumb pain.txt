There are many causes of thumb pain. You can often ease the pain yourself. But see a GP if the pain does not improve.

How you can ease thumb pain yourself
If you see a GP about pain in your thumb, they'll usually suggest you try these things:
Do
rest your thumb when you can
put an ice pack (or a bag of frozen peas) in a towel and place it on your thumb for up to 20 minutes every 2 to 3 hours
take
paracetamol
take off any jewellery if your thumb looks swollen
stop or cut down activities that are causing the pain – for example, typing, using vibrating tools for work, or playing an instrument
wear a splint to support your thumb and ease pain, especially at night – you can get these at most pharmacies and supermarkets
consider taping something like a lollipop stick to your thumb – this will keep it in place until you can get a splint
consider using gadgets or tools to make difficult or painful tasks easier – for example, to open jars or chop vegetables
keep your thumb moving with gentle exercises
Don’t
do not use ibuprofen in the first 48 hours after an injury
do not use heat packs or have hot baths for the first 2 to 3 days after an injury
do not lift heavy objects or grip anything too tightly
A pharmacist can help with thumb pain
You can ask a pharmacist about:
the best painkiller to take
the best splint to support your thumb and ease pain – flexible rubber splints are available if you still need to use your thumb
if you need to see a GP
Find a pharmacy
