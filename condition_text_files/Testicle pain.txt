Causes of testicle pain
Sudden, severe testicle pain can be caused by twisting of the testicle (testicular torsion).
This is a serious problem that can lead to the loss of the testicle if it's not treated quickly.
Less serious causes of testicle pain include:
an infection (
epididymitis
)
an injury
an
inguinal hernia
a build-up of fluid (cyst)
swollen veins in the testicles (varicocele)
Pain by itself is not usually a sign of
testicular cancer
. Cancer usually causes other symptoms like a
lump or swelling in your testicle
.
Do not try to self-diagnose the cause of your pain. Get medical help if you're worried.
