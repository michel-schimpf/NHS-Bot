An infected piercing can be serious if it's not treated quickly. Get immediate medical help if you think your piercing is infected.

Check if you have an infected piercing
What's normal for a new piercing
For the first few weeks a new piercing might:
be tender, itchy, and the surrounding area may look slightly red on white skin, or a little darker than usual on dark skin
produce a pale fluid that forms a crust
If you've had an ear or nose cartilage piercing, small lumps can sometimes form around the piercing.
The lumps, called granulomas, are trapped fluid. You can treat them by soaking a pad in warm water then holding the pad against them once a day.
Signs of an infection
Your piercing might be infected if:
the area around it is swollen, painful, hot, very red or dark (depending on your skin colour)
there's blood or pus coming out of it – pus can be white, green or yellow
you feel hot or shivery or generally unwell

How to prevent infections in new piercings
There are things you can do to reduce the risk of a piercing getting infected.
Do
choose a qualified, experienced and licensed piercer
clean your piercing twice a day

gently turn the jewellery while cleaning the piercing
use a clean paper towel to dry the piercing
gargle with salty water or an alcohol-free mouthwash if you have a mouth piercing
Don’t

do not pick at any crusting
do not twist or turn jewellery when the piercing is dry
do not use a towel to dry the piercing
do not have sex until a genital piercing has healed
do not have oral sex until a mouth piercing has healed
do not go swimming for the first 24 hours after a piercing

to explain what they're going to do
whether there are any risks

how long it will take to heal
