Treatments for psoriatic arthritis
Medicines are the main treatment for psoriatic arthritis. If a medicine does not help with your symptoms tell your doctor. Another medicine may work better for you.
Medicines for psoriatic arthritis
The medicines used to treat psoriatic arthritis include:
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
– they come as tablets, creams or gels and can help with mild symptoms
steroid injections
– a steroid medicine is injected into a joint to help ease the pain
disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) – used for moderate to severe symptoms, DMARDs can take several months to work so keep taking them even if you do not feel better straight away
biological treatments – usually given by injection, biological treatments can be used if DMARDs do not help
Other treatments for psoriatic arthritis
Your doctor may also refer you to a physiotherapist, occupational therapist, or both.
A physiotherapist can teach you exercises to help strengthen your joints and prevent joint damage.
An occupational therapist can discuss adjustments you can make at home and at work. For example, they may recommend equipment that makes certain tasks easier.
