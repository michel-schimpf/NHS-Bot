It's also possible to get patches on the floor or roof of your mouth.
The patches:
are not painful
are an irregular shape
are slightly raised
may be slightly red within the patch
cannot be rubbed or scraped away (patches that can be removed could be
oral thrush
)
There are also a number of other causes of a
white tongue
.

Non-urgent advice:
See a dentist or GP if:
you have a white patch in your mouth that has not gone away after 2 weeks
you have a white patch on your tongue and a weakened immune system – for example, you have
HIV
or have had an organ transplant
What happens at your appointment
Your dentist or GP will examine the patch and be able to rule out other possible causes, like a fungal infection of the mouth (oral thrush) or cheek biting.
You may be referred to a specialist for a
biopsy
. A small piece of tissue from the patch will be removed and checked for abnormal cells.

Mouth cancer risk
If you have leukoplakia, there's a small risk it could progress to mouth cancer over time.
This is why it's important to see your dentist or GP if you have a white patch in your mouth.

Treatments for leukoplakia
Treatment for leukoplakia is not always needed, but you'll have regular check-ups to make sure the patch is not getting bigger.
The patch may get smaller or go away if you:
stop smoking
reduce the amount of alcohol you drink
An operation is sometimes needed to remove the patch if there's a risk it could become cancerous.
This may be done
while the area is numbed (local anaesthetic)
or
while you're asleep (general anaesthetic)
.
The patch can be removed in a number of ways, including using a laser or a surgical scalpel. Your mouth should heal quickly afterwards.

Preventing leukoplakia and mouth cancer
In the UK, leukoplakia is mostly caused by smoking. But sometimes the exact cause is not known.
There are things you can do to reduce your risk of getting leukoplakia. These may also reduce your chances of getting mouth cancer.
Do
keep your mouth and teeth healthy by
taking care of your teeth and gums
have regular
dental check-ups
if you wear
dentures
, make sure they fit properly
eat a
balanced diet
, including plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables
Don’t
do not smoke
do not
chew tobacco, paan or betel nuts
do not drink more than the
recommended amount of alcohol

Hairy leukoplakia
Hairy leukoplakia is a type of leukoplakia caused by the Epstein-Barr virus.
You may have this type if you have a weakened immune system – for example, you have
HIV
or have had an organ transplant.
It causes fuzzy white patches, often on the sides of the tongue, that look folded or ridged. They're not painful and cannot be brushed or scraped away.
Antiviral medicines, or treatments applied directly to the patch, may be prescribed to treat hairy leukoplakia.
Unlike other types of leukoplakia, hairy leukoplakia does not carry a risk of mouth cancer.
