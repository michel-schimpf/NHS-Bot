There are many causes of finger pain. You can often ease the pain yourself. But see a GP if the pain does not improve.

How you can ease finger pain yourself
If you see a GP about pain in your finger, they'll usually suggest you try these things:
Do
rest your finger when you can
put an ice pack (or a bag of frozen peas) in a towel and place it on your finger for up to 20 minutes every 2 to 3 hours
take
paracetamol
to ease the pain
stop or cut down activities that are causing the pain – for example, typing, using vibrating tools for work, or playing an instrument
remove any jewellery on the painful finger
strap the painful finger to another finger next to it – put a small piece of cotton wool or gauze between the 2 fingers and use tape to loosely strap them together
think about using gadgets or tools to make difficult or painful tasks easier – for example, to open jars or chop vegetables
Don’t
do not use
ibuprofen
in the first 48 hours after an injury
do not use heat packs or have hot baths for the first 2 to 3 days after an injury
do not lift heavy objects or grip anything too tightly
do not stop using your finger completely – after a few days, do gentle hands and finger exercises to help ease any stiffness
