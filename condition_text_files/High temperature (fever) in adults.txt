What is a high temperature?
Normal body temperature is different for everyone and changes during the day.
A high temperature is usually considered to be 38C or above. This is sometimes called a fever.

Check if you have a high temperature

your chest or back feel hotter than usual
you have other symptoms, such as shivering (chills), sweating or warm, red skin (this may be harder to see on black or brown skin)
a thermometer says your temperature is 38C or above
Important
If you feel hot or shivery, you may have a high temperature even if a thermometer says your temperature is below 38C.

Do I need to take my temperature?
