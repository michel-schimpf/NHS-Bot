Stretch marks are very common. They're harmless and often get less visible over time.

Check if you have stretch marks
Stretch marks look like lines or streaks across the skin.
Stretch marks can be pink, red, brown, black, silver or purple. They usually start off darker and fade over time.

Common causes of stretch marks
Stretch marks are often caused by sudden growth or weight gain.
You may be more likely to get them if you:

lose or gain weight quickly
are female
are overweight
use some kinds of
steroid creams or tablets
have a family member with stretch marks
Rarely, stretch marks can be due to a condition called
Cushing's syndrome
.

What to do about stretch marks
Stretch marks usually fade over time but may not disappear completely.
Many creams and lotions claim to prevent, reduce or remove stretch marks. But there's very little evidence these work.
There are some treatments that may help make stretch marks look better, but they will not get rid of them.
They include:
retinoid (often called tretinoin) creams or hyaluronic acid â€“ these may help if used on new stretch marks, but you should not use retinoid creams if you're pregnant as they may harm your baby
light or laser treatments
microdermabrasion
, which removes a thin layer of skin
You would need to pay for these treatments as they're not available on the NHS.
Information:
It's not always possible to prevent stretch marks. The best way to reduce your chance of getting them is by maintaining a healthy weight.

Non-urgent advice:
See a GP if:
You have large stretch marks and:
more fat on your chest and tummy, but slim arms and legs
a build-up of fat on the back of your neck and shoulders
a red, puffy, rounded face
These could be symptoms of
Cushing's syndrome
.
