Things you can do to help with nappy rash
Nappy rash can be treated and prevented by following some simple advice.
Do
change wet or dirty nappies as soon as possible
keep the skin clean and dry – pat or rub the skin gently to dry it
leave nappies off when possible
use extra absorbent nappies
make sure your baby's nappies fit properly
clean your baby's skin with water or fragrance-free and alcohol-free baby wipes
bath your baby daily (but not more than twice a day, as washing too much can make the skin dry out)
Don’t
do not use soaps, baby lotion or bubble bath as they can irritate the skin
do not use talcum powder or antiseptics on nappy rash
do not put nappies on too tightly as it can irritate the skin
A pharmacist can help with nappy rash
If the rash is causing your baby discomfort, a pharmacist can recommend a nappy rash cream or medicine to treat it at home.
They may suggest using a thin layer of a barrier cream to protect the skin or giving your baby
child's paracetamol
for pain relief (only suitable for babies over 2 months old).
