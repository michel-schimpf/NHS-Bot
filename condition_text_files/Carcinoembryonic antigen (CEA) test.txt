A carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) test is used to check how well treatment is working in certain types of cancer, particularly
bowel cancer
.
Carcinoembryonic antigens are proteins produced by some types of
cancer
.
In response to the antigens, the body produces antibodies to help fight them.
A CEA test is often carried out after surgery to check carcinoembryonic antigen levels.
As well as being a useful marker for bowel cancer, CEA tests can be used to assess other types of cancer, including:
lung cancer
breast cancer
liver cancer
pancreatic cancer
stomach cancer
ovarian cancer
CEA levels may also be raised in non-cancerous conditions, such as
liver disease
and
inflammatory bowel disease
(
Crohn's disease
and
ulcerative colitis
).
