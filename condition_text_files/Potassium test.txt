A potassium test measures the amount of potassium in blood serum, the fluid part of your blood.
Potassium
is a mineral that helps:
nerves and muscles "communicate"
nutrients move into cells and waste products move out of cells
the heart function healthily
There are several reasons why a doctor might recommend you have a potassium test, including:
to help diagnose or monitor
kidney disease
, which is the most common cause of high potassium levels
if you have heart-related problems, such as
high blood pressure (hypertension)
if you take certain medicines that can affect your potassium levels
if you have
diabetes
and your doctor thinks you may have
diabetic ketoacidosis
, a serious complication caused by a lack of insulin in the body
If you have low potassium levels, you may have a heart problem, such as an
irregular heartbeat
.
If you have high potassium levels, your heart muscle activity may be reduced.
Both situations are serious and can be life threatening.
In rare cases, potassium levels may be low through a poor diet.
Good sources of dietary potassium include:
fruit, particularly bananas
some vegetables
pulses
nuts and seeds
milk
fish
shellfish
beef
chicken
turkey
bread
