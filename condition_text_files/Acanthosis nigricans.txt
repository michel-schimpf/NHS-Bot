Sometimes the skin may be itchy.

Non-urgent advice:
See a GP if you have:
new dark patches on your skin
any skin changes you're unsure about
What happens at your appointment
Although acanthosis nigricans is usually harmless, it's best to get any skin changes checked out.
Rarely, it can be a sign of something more serious, such as cancer.
A GP can usually tell if it's acanthosis nigricans by looking at your skin.
You may need some tests to find out what's causing the patches.

Causes of acanthosis nigricans
The most common cause of acanthosis nigricans is being
very overweight
.
Other causes include:
type 2 diabetes
conditions that affect hormone levels – such as
Cushing's syndrome
,
polycystic ovary syndrome
or an
underactive thyroid
taking certain medicines – including
steroids
or hormone treatments like the contraceptive pill
rarely, cancer – usually
stomach cancer
rarely, a faulty gene inherited from your parents
Sometimes healthy people with no other conditions get acanthosis nigricans. This is more common in people with black or brown skin.

Treating acanthosis nigricans
Once a GP knows what's causing acanthosis nigricans, they can recommend the best treatment.
The patches should fade over time once the cause is treated.
If you're very overweight, a GP may recommend
losing weight
.
Depending on the cause, they may also recommend:
medicine to balance your hormones
medicine to balance your insulin levels
changing your medicine to one that does not cause the patches
There's no specific treatment for the patches themselves. A skin specialist (dermatologist) may be able to suggest treatments to improve their appearance, but finding and treating the cause is usually recommended first.
