A total protein test measures the amount of protein in your blood.
Proteins are important for the health and growth of the body's cells and tissues.
The test can help diagnose a number of health conditions, including:
kidney disease
liver disease
malnutrition
– a serious condition that occurs when a person's diet doesn't contain enough nutrients to meet their body's needs
If your total protein level is low, you may have a liver or kidney problem, or it may be that protein isn't being digested or absorbed properly.
A high total protein level could indicate
dehydration
or a certain type of
cancer
, such as
multiple myeloma
, that causes protein to accumulate abnormally.
If the result of a total protein test is abnormal, further tests will be needed to identify which proteins are too high or too low. This will enable an accurate diagnosis to be made.
