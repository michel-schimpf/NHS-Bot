Limping in children is not usually serious and could be caused by something minor like a sprain or strain. But you should see a GP if it's not obvious what's causing it.

Causes of limping in children
Limping in children is often caused by an obvious injury to the leg or foot, such as:
a
sprain or strain
a
blister
, cut or bruise
a
broken bone
Sometimes it may not be clear what's causing your child to limp. The symptoms might give you an idea of what the cause might be.
But do not self-diagnose â€“ a limp with no obvious cause should always be checked by a GP as it could be a sign of something serious.

you can manage to get up, wash or dress

comes and goes

Treatment from a GP
Treatment will depend on what's causing your child to limp. Sometimes it may get better on its own.
A GP will examine your child and may arrange for more tests to find out what's causing your child to limp.
They might:
give you advice on
how to treat a sprain or strain
at home, such as rest and taking paracetamol or ibuprofen
refer you to hospital for an
X-ray
or to a specialist (for example, a paediatric orthopaedic surgeon) to help find the cause
