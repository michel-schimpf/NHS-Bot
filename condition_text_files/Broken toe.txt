A broken toe can be painful, but you do not usually need to go to hospital. There are things you can do to treat it at home.

Check if you have a broken toe
You may have broken your toe if it's:
red or bruised
painful and swollen
difficult to walk on
Information:
Do not worry if you're not sure if it's broken or just bruised, treatment is usually the same for both.

Urgent advice:
Get help from NHS 111 if:
you have a bad cut or wound after injuring your toe
you have severe toe pain
your child has hurt or broken their toe
You may need further treatment in hospital, such as a boot, cast or surgery.

What we mean by severe pain
Severe pain:
always there and so bad it's hard to think or talk
you cannot sleep
it's very hard to move, get out of bed, go to the bathroom, wash or dress
Moderate pain:
always there
makes it hard to concentrate or sleep
you can manage to get up, wash or dress
Mild pain:
comes and goes
is annoying but does not stop you doing daily activities

Immediate action required:
Go to A&E if:
you think you have broken your big toe
your toe is pointing out at an odd angle
the bone is sticking out of your toe
there was a snap, grinding or popping noise at the time of injury
you feel tingling in your toe or foot or it feels numb
If you cannot get to A&E by yourself, call 999 for an ambulace.

What you can do about a broken toe
Doctors will usually suggest you treat a broken toe at home first if:
it's not your big toe
the bone is not sticking out of your foot
your toe is not pointing at an odd angle
there's no wound on your toe
Broken toes usually heal within 4 to 6 weeks, but it can sometimes take several months.
Do
take
ibuprofen
or
paracetamol
for the pain and swelling
rest your foot and keep it raised
hold an ice pack (or a bag of frozen peas) wrapped in a towel on your toe for up to 20 minutes every few hours
wear wide, comfortable shoes with a low heel
avoid walking around as much as possible
strap up your broken toe – put a small piece of cotton wool or gauze between your sore toe and the toe next to it, then tape them together to support the sore toe
Don’t
do not strap up your toe if it's pointing out at an odd angle or you have hurt your big toe – get medical advice
do not put ice directly on your skin
do not walk or stand for long periods
do not wear tight, pointy shoes
do not play any sports like football, rugby or hockey for 6 weeks or until the pain eases
do not try to treat your child's toe – take them to an urgent treatment centre or A&E
A pharmacist can help with a broken toe
You can ask a pharmacist about:
the best painkiller to take
what you need to strap up your toe
if you need to see a GP
Find a pharmacy

Non-urgent advice:
See a GP if:
pain and swelling has not started to ease 2 to 3 days after you injured your toe
it still hurts to walk 6 weeks after injuring your toe
you have diabetes and have injured your toe – foot problems can be more serious if you have diabetes
They may send you for an X-ray to see if you need any further treatment.
