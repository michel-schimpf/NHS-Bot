Paralysis is when you are not able to move some or all your body. It can be temporary or permanent depending on what causes it.

Symptoms of paralysis
You may have paralysis if:
you cannot move some or all of your face or body
your face or body is weak or floppy
your face or body is numb, painful or tingles all the time
your face or body is stiff with muscle spasms and twitches
This can start suddenly or gradually, or come and go.

Immediate action required:
Call 999 if:
You or someone else has paralysis or weakness:
that happened suddenly
after a injury to the head, neck or back
that causes problems with speech, breathing or swallowing
that affects 1 side of the face (your face may droop on 1 side) or 1 arm (you may not be able to lift both arms and keep them there)
and cannot feel part or all of your face and body, and you feel tingling
These problems could be a sign of something serious that needs to be treated in hospital straight away.

transient ischaemic attack
(TIA or "mini-stroke") or
stroke
(paralysis in 1 half of the face with arm weakness)
