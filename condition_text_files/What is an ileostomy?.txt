An ileostomy is where the end of your small bowel is brought through an opening made in your tummy. The opening is called a stoma.
You will no longer poo from your bottom â€“ it will come out of the stoma into a pouch or bag you stick on your tummy.
It's usually done because your large bowel needs to be removed, or rested after surgery.
There are 2 types, an end or loop ileostomy.
It may be temporary and reversed later, or permanent, depending on why it's needed.
A stoma might be flat against your skin or stick out a couple of centimetres. It should be soft, slippery and pink, like the inside of your mouth.
The stoma should not hurt, but it can bleed easily when scratched or wiped.
The poo in the stoma bag is liquid or soft, like porridge. But you can still become constipated or have diarrhoea.
You cannot control when poo, wind or bowel sounds come out your stoma. It might happen for a few hours each day or more often.
