Cradle cap is a harmless skin condition that's common in babies. It usually goes away on its own in 6 to 12 months, but there are things you can try to make it better.

Check if your baby has cradle cap
The main symptom of cradle cap is patches of greasy, scaly skin.
It's usually found on the scalp and face, but sometimes affects the nappy area. It can look like:
patches of white or yellow greasy scales on the scalp and face that form a crust which might flake off
small, dry flakes of skin on the nappy area
The scales look similar on all skin tones. But the skin under the scales may look pink or red if your baby has white skin, or lighter or darker than the surrounding skin if your baby has brown or black skin.
It is not itchy or painful and does not bother your baby.
The cause of cradle cap is not clear, but it cannot be caught from other babies.

Things you can do to help with cradle cap
Do
lightly massage an
emollient
(moisturiser) on to your baby's scalp to help loosen the scales
gently brush your baby's scalp with a soft brush and then wash it with baby shampoo
Donâ€™t

do not use peanut oil (because of the allergy risk)
do not use soap or adult shampoos

See a GP if:
your baby's cradle cap does not get better after a few weeks of treatment
your baby has cradle cap all over their body
the crusts bleed or leak fluid
