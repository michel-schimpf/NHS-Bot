Treatment for migraines
Migraine treatments include:
painkillers such as ibuprofen and paracetamol
medicines called triptans
medicines that stop you feeling sick or being sick
You may have to try a combination of medicines before you find something that works.
A GP may also recommend making changes to your lifestyle to help manage your migraines, such as eating at regular times and drinking less caffeine.
If your migraines are severe, you might be offered other things to help, such as learning relaxation techniques and acupuncture.
If these treatments do not manage your migraines or they're getting worse, you may be referred to a specialist for further tests and treatment.
Important
Try not to take high doses of painkillers too often as this could make it harder to treat your migraines.
