Most people forget things from time to time, but see a GP if you keep having problems with your memory. It could be caused by something that can be treated.

Non-urgent advice:
See a GP if:
memory problems are affecting your day-to-day life
It's often nothing serious, but it's best to get checked because any treatment you need may work better if it's started early.
Important:
Concern for a relative
If you're worried about an older relative who's becoming increasingly forgetful, speak to a GP about whether it could be a
sign of dementia
.

What happens at your appointment
If you're having problems with your memory, a GP will ask you some questions to try to find the cause.
It might be useful to bring someone else with you who can help describe the problems you're having.
The GP may refer you to a memory specialist for an in-depth assessment. Further tests, such as scans, may also sometimes be needed.
Any treatment that's recommended will depend on the cause of your memory problems.

Causes of memory loss
Memory loss can just be a natural part of getting older.
Sometimes it may be caused by something common and treatable like:
stress
anxiety
or
depression
sleeping problems (insomnia)
Occasionally, memory loss can be a sign of something more serious, such as
dementia
.
Do not try to self-diagnose the cause of your memory loss â€“ always see a GP.
