Auditory processing disorder (APD) is where you have difficulty understanding sounds, including spoken words. There are things you can do that can help.

Check if you or your child have auditory processing disorder (APD)
Auditory processing disorder (APD) often starts in childhood, but some people develop it later.
If you or your child have APD, you may find it difficult to understand:

people with strong accents or fast talkers
similar sounding words
spoken instructions
APD is not a hearing problem. People with the condition usually have normal hearing.

See a GP if:
you or your child find it hard to hear or understand speech
The GP may refer you to a hearing specialist.

listen to speech with background noise
spot small changes in sounds
fill in missing parts of words
Other tests may include:

speech and language tests
memory, problem-solving and concentration tests
Testing for APD is not usually done on children under 7 years old.
