Vomiting blood (called haematemesis) needs to be checked. It often needs emergency treatment.
Vomit can vary from bright red to brown or black. It may be like liquid or more solid, or look like coffee granules.

Causes of vomiting blood
There are many possible causes of vomiting blood.
It's often a sign of bleeding somewhere in your food pipe (oesophagus), which runs from your mouth to your stomach.
Common causes of vomiting blood include:
gastritis
stomach ulcers
heart burn and acid reflux
alcohol-related liver disease
damage to your food pipe from being sick or coughing a lot
Less common causes include:
oesophageal cancer
or
stomach cancer
blood conditions, such as
haemophilia
some medicines, including aspirin, anti-inflammatory painkillers such as
ibuprofen
and
anticoagulant medicines
(blood thinning medicines)
poisoning
It's also possible to vomit blood that was swallowed. For example, from a nosebleed or a baby breastfeeding on a bleeding nipple.
