Late or missed periods can be caused by many things. Most of the time itâ€™s nothing to worry about but see a doctor about them just in case.

Causes of missed or late periods
Many women will have missed or late periods at some time. Missed or late periods can affect anyone who has periods.
Common causes of a missed or late period include:
being pregnant
stress
the start of
menopause
(perimenopause), usually between the ages of 45 and 55
polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
sudden weight loss
being overweight

Sometimes the gap between your periods may just vary each time. Your periods might come early or late. This is known as having
irregular periods
.
Periods can also sometimes stop as a result of a medical condition, such as
heart disease
,
diabetes
or an
overactive thyroid
.
