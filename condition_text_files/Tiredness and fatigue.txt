It's normal to feel tired sometimes. But if you're tired all the time and do not know why, it could be a sign of a problem.

Causes of tiredness and fatigue
Common causes of tiredness and fatigue include:
not getting enough sleep or finding it hard to get to sleep (
insomnia
)
an unhealthy lifestyle (such as having an unhealthy diet and not getting much exercise)
stress
,
depression
and dealing with life challenges, such as
bereavement
or looking after a new baby
hormonal changes (such as during puberty,
pregnancy
or the
menopause
)
some illnesses, like
glandular fever
and
COVID-19
some medical treatments and medicines, like chemotherapy, which can cause drowsiness for a while
But if you cannot explain why you're tired and it's been going on for a while and not getting any better, it may be a sign of a medical condition.
Your symptoms might give you an idea of what's causing your tiredness or fatigue. But do not self-diagnose – see a GP if you're worried.
