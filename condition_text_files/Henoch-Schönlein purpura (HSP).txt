How to do the glass test

Treatments for Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP)
There's no treatment for Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP). It usually gets better in a few weeks and you can usually just rest at home until you feel better.
HSP cannot spread to others, so:
your child can return to school or nursery when they feel well enough
you can go back to work as soon as you feel up to it
Treatment to relieve your symptoms
Paracetamol
can help ease any pain.
Do not take
ibuprofen
without speaking to your doctor because it could harm your kidneys.
Regular check-ups for kidney problems
You'll have regular check-ups for 6 to 12 months to check how well your kidneys are working.
You'll usually be asked to provide a sample of pee and have your blood pressure checked at each appointment. This may be done at home, at your GP surgery, or in hospital.
Treatment in hospital
You may need to go into hospital if HSP affects your kidneys.
In hospital, you may be given strong medicines like
steroids
to help ease your symptoms.

Risks of Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP)
Most people with Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) make a full recovery. Any kidney problems usually get better without treatment.
But sometimes HSP can be severe and last several months.
There's also a small chance the kidneys could be permanently damaged (
chronic kidney disease
). This is why it's important to have regular check-ups.
Important:
Getting HSP again
You can get HSP more than once. Get medical advice quickly if the symptoms come back.
