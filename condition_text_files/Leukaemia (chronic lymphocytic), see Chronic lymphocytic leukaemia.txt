Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia is a rare type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow.
It usually develops very slowly and does not always need to be treated straight away.
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia cannot usually be cured, but it can be managed with treatment.
It's more common as you get older. It's very rare in people under 40.
It's not clear what causes chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, but having a close family member who's had it may mean you have a slightly higher risk.

Important:
Get your symptoms checked
It's important to get any
symptoms of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia
checked as soon as possible. Finding it early can mean it's more treatable.
