Most neck pain only lasts a few weeks. There are things you can do yourself to ease it, but see a GP if it does not go away.

How you can ease neck pain yourself
Do
take
paracetamol
or
ibuprofen
– or use ibuprofen gel on your neck
use a low, firm pillow
put heat or cold packs on your neck
try
neck flexibility exercises
Don’t
do not wear a neck collar – it's better to keep your neck moving (unless a doctor tells you not to)
do not do anything that could be dangerous because you cannot move your neck – for example, driving or cycling
Putting heat or cold packs on your neck
Try either of these:
a pack of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel for 5 minutes, 3 times a day
a hot water bottle wrapped in a tea towel for 20 minutes, 2 to 3 times a day
You can also buy heat or cold packs from a pharmacy.

Non-urgent advice:
See a GP if:
neck pain or stiffness does not go away after a few weeks
painkillers like paracetamol or ibuprofen have not worked
you're worried about the pain
you have other symptoms, like pins and needles or a cold arm – this could be something more serious

What can cause neck pain
The most common causes of neck pain are:
the neck becoming locked in an awkward position while sleeping
bad posture – for example, when sitting at a desk for a long time
a pinched nerve
an injury – for example,
whiplash
from a traffic accident or fall

How you can prevent neck pain
Do
when sleeping, make sure your head is the same height as the rest of your body
have a firm mattress
sit upright – roll your shoulders back gently and bring your neck back
Don’t
do not keep your neck in the same position for a long time – for example, when sitting at a desk
do not sleep on your front
do not twist your neck when you're in bed
