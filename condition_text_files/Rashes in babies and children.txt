Many things can cause a rash in babies and children, and they're often nothing to worry about.
This page covers some of the common rashes in babies and children.
As a parent, you may know if your child seems seriously unwell and should trust your judgement.

Immediate action required:
Call 999 or go to A&E now if:
Your child is unwell with a rash and has any of these symptoms:
a stiff neck
bothered by light
seems confused
a high temperature
difficulty breathing (you may notice grunting noises or their tummy sucking under their ribs), breathlessness, or they're breathing very fast
a rash that looks like small bruises or bleeding under the skin and does not fade when you press a glass against it
their skin, lips or tongue look pale, blue, grey or blotchy
On brown and black skin, it may be easier to see the rash or colour changes on the soles of the feet, palms, lips, tongue and inside the eyelids.

Urgent advice:
Ask for an urgent GP appointment or call 111 if:
you're worried about your child's rash and you're not sure what to do

A rash of small, raised bumps that feels rough, like sandpaper, could be scarlet fever.
Speak to a GP if you think your child has scarlet fever.
Scarlet fever symptoms and what to do
Check if you have scarlet fever
The first signs of scarlet fever can be flu-like symptoms, including a high temperature, a sore throat and swollen neck glands (a large lump on the side of your neck).
A rash appears 12 to 48 hours later. It looks like small, raised bumps and starts on the chest and tummy, then spreads. The rash makes your skin feel rough, like sandpaper.
On white skin the rash looks pink or red. On brown and black skin it might be harder to see a change in colour, but you can still feel the rash and see the raised bumps.

The symptoms are the same for children and adults, although scarlet fever is less common in adults.
Non-urgent advice:
See a GP if you or your child:
have scarlet fever symptoms
do not get better in a week (after seeing a GP)
have scarlet fever and chickenpox at the same time
are ill again, weeks after scarlet fever got better – this can be a sign of a complication, such as
rheumatic fever
are feeling unwell and have been in contact with someone who has scarlet fever
Scarlet fever is very easily spread. Check with a GP before you go in. They may suggest a phone consultation.

A rash of small, raised spots that feels itchy or prickly could be heat rash (prickly heat).
Heat rash can usually be treated at home.
Heat rash symptoms and what to do
Check if you have heat rash
The symptoms of heat rash are:
small, raised spots
an itchy, prickly feeling
mild swelling
The rash often looks red, but this may be less obvious on brown or black skin.
The symptoms of heat rash are often the same in adults and children.
It can appear anywhere on the body and spread, but it cannot be passed on to other people.
Heat rash appears as raised spots that are 2mm to 4mm across. Some spots may be filled with fluid.

CID - ISM / SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/1036411/view
How you can treat or prevent heat rash yourself
The main thing to do is keep your skin cool so you do not sweat and irritate the rash.
To keep your skin cool
wear loose cotton clothing
use lightweight bedding
take cool baths or showers
drink plenty of fluid to avoid dehydration
To calm the itching or prickly feeling
apply something cold, such as a damp cloth or ice pack (wrapped in a tea towel) for up to 20 minutes
tap or pat the rash instead of scratching it
do not use perfumed shower gels or creams

appear anywhere on the body
be on 1 area or spread across the body
feel itchy, sting or burn
look pink or red when affecting someone with white skin; the colour of the rash can be harder to see on brown and black skin

Ringworm can usually be treated at home.
Ringworm symptoms and what to do
Check if it's ringworm
The main symptom of ringworm is a rash. It may look red or darker than the surrounding skin, depending on your skin tone.
The rash may be scaly, dry, swollen or itchy.
Ringworm can appear anywhere on the body, including the scalp (tinea capitis) and groin (jock itch).
The rash is usually ring-shaped, but it may look different on your face, neck or scalp.

A pharmacist can help with ringworm
Speak to a pharmacist first if you think you have ringworm.
They can look at the rash and recommend the best antifungal medicine. This might be tablets, cream, gel or spray depending on where the rash is.
You may need to use an antifungal medicine every day for up to 4 weeks. It's important to use it for the right amount of time, even if the rash has gone away.
A pharmacist will tell you if they think you should see a GP.

Small, itchy spots that turn into blisters and scabs could be chickenpox.
Chickenpox can usually be treated at home.
Chickenpox symptoms and what to do
Check if it's chickenpox
An itchy, spotty rash is the main symptom of chickenpox. It can be anywhere on the body.
Chickenpox happens in 3 stages. But new spots can appear while others are becoming blisters or forming a scab.
Stage 1: small spots appear
The spots can:
be anywhere on the body, including inside the mouth and around the genitals, which can be painful
spread or stay in a small area
be red, pink, darker or the same colour as surrounding skin, depending on your skin tone
be harder to see on brown and black skin

Medium brown skin with stage 3 chickenpox spots. The spots cover the lower part of a person's back and the side of their hip.
There are about 50 spots in total, varying in size from about 1mm to 1cm. Some are 1cm to 3cm apart, but others are further apart.
Most of the spots have scabs over them. The scabs are pink, purple or grey. There are also a few spots without scabs, which look like small blisters. These are slightly darker in colour than the person's skin.
Other symptoms
Before or after the rash appears, you might also get:
a high temperature
aches and pains, and generally feeling unwell
loss of appetite
Chickenpox is very itchy and can make children feel miserable, even if they do not have many spots.
The chickenpox spots look the same on children and adults. But adults usually have a high temperature for longer and more spots than children.
It's possible to get chickenpox more than once, but it's unusual.
How to treat chickenpox at home
Important:
Stay off school or work
You'll need to stay away from school, nursery or work until all the spots have formed a scab. This is usually 5 days after the spots appeared.
Do
drink plenty of fluid (try ice lollies if your child is not drinking) to avoid dehydration
take
paracetamol
to help with pain and discomfort
cut your child's fingernails and put socks on their hands at night to stop them scratching
use cooling creams or gels from a pharmacy
speak to a pharmacist about using
antihistamine medicine
to help itching
bathe in cool water and pat the skin dry (do not rub)
dress in loose clothes
Don’t
do not use
ibuprofen
unless advised to do so by a doctor, as it may cause serious skin infections
do not give aspirin to children under 16
do not go near newborn babies, people who are pregnant and people with a weakened immune system, as chickenpox can be dangerous for them
do not scratch the spots, as scratching can cause scarring

Sores or blisters that burst and leave crusty, golden-brown patches could be impetigo. The sores or blisters can be itchy, get bigger or spread to other parts of the body.
Speak to a GP if you think your child may have impetigo.
Impetigo symptoms and what to do
Check if you have impetigo
Impetigo starts with red sores or blisters, but the redness may be harder to see in brown and black skin.
The sores or blisters quickly burst and leave crusty, golden-brown patches.
The patches can:
look a bit like cornflakes stuck to your skin
get bigger
spread to other parts of your body
be itchy
sometimes be painful
Sores (non-bullous impetigo) or blisters (bullous impetigo) can start anywhere – but usually on exposed areas like your face and hands.

Non-urgent advice:
See a GP if you or your child:
might have impetigo
had treatment for impetigo but the symptoms change or get worse
had impetigo before and it keeps coming back
Impetigo is very infectious. Check with the GP before you go into the surgery. They may suggest a phone consultation.

Very itchy raised spots could be caused by tiny mites that burrow into the skin (scabies). There may be raised lines with a dot at one end, often first appearing between the fingers.
Scabies can usually be treated at home.
Scabies symptoms and what to do
Check if it's scabies
The symptoms of scabies are:
intense itching, especially at night
a raised rash or spots
The spots may look red. They are more difficult to see on dark skin, but you should be able to feel them.
Tiny mites lay eggs in the skin, leaving lines with a dot at one end.

The scabies rash usually spreads across the whole body, apart from the head.
However, older people, young children and those with a weakened immune system may develop a rash on their head and neck.
A pharmacist can help with scabies
Scabies is not usually a serious condition, but it does need to be treated.
A pharmacist will recommend a cream or lotion that you apply over your whole body. It's important to read the instructions carefully.
Let the pharmacist know if you are breastfeeding or pregnant.
You'll need to repeat the treatment 1 week later.
Scabies is very infectious, but it can take up to 8 weeks for the rash to appear.
Everyone in your home needs to be treated at the same time, even if they do not have symptoms.
Anyone you have had sexual contact with in the past 8 weeks should also be treated.
Find a pharmacy

Check if you have heat rash
The symptoms of heat rash are:
small, raised spots
an itchy, prickly feeling
mild swelling
The rash often looks red, but this may be less obvious on brown or black skin.
The symptoms of heat rash are often the same in adults and children.
It can appear anywhere on the body and spread, but it cannot be passed on to other people.
Heat rash appears as raised spots that are 2mm to 4mm across. Some spots may be filled with fluid.

CID - ISM / SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/1036411/view

How you can treat or prevent heat rash yourself
The main thing to do is keep your skin cool so you do not sweat and irritate the rash.
To keep your skin cool
wear loose cotton clothing
use lightweight bedding
take cool baths or showers
drink plenty of fluid to avoid dehydration
To calm the itching or prickly feeling
apply something cold, such as a damp cloth or ice pack (wrapped in a tea towel) for up to 20 minutes
tap or pat the rash instead of scratching it
do not use perfumed shower gels or creams

Check if it's hives
The main symptom of hives is an itchy rash.
The rash can:
be raised bumps or patches in many shapes and sizes
appear anywhere on the body
be on 1 area or spread across the body
feel itchy, sting or burn
look pink or red when affecting someone with white skin; the colour of the rash can be harder to see on brown and black skin

Check if it's ringworm
The main symptom of ringworm is a rash. It may look red or darker than the surrounding skin, depending on your skin tone.
The rash may be scaly, dry, swollen or itchy.
Ringworm can appear anywhere on the body, including the scalp (tinea capitis) and groin (jock itch).
The rash is usually ring-shaped, but it may look different on your face, neck or scalp.

A pharmacist can help with ringworm
Speak to a pharmacist first if you think you have ringworm.
They can look at the rash and recommend the best antifungal medicine. This might be tablets, cream, gel or spray depending on where the rash is.
You may need to use an antifungal medicine every day for up to 4 weeks. It's important to use it for the right amount of time, even if the rash has gone away.
A pharmacist will tell you if they think you should see a GP.

Check if it's chickenpox
An itchy, spotty rash is the main symptom of chickenpox. It can be anywhere on the body.
Chickenpox happens in 3 stages. But new spots can appear while others are becoming blisters or forming a scab.
Stage 1: small spots appear
The spots can:
be anywhere on the body, including inside the mouth and around the genitals, which can be painful
spread or stay in a small area
be red, pink, darker or the same colour as surrounding skin, depending on your skin tone
be harder to see on brown and black skin

Medium brown skin with stage 3 chickenpox spots. The spots cover the lower part of a person's back and the side of their hip.
There are about 50 spots in total, varying in size from about 1mm to 1cm. Some are 1cm to 3cm apart, but others are further apart.
Most of the spots have scabs over them. The scabs are pink, purple or grey. There are also a few spots without scabs, which look like small blisters. These are slightly darker in colour than the person's skin.
Other symptoms
Before or after the rash appears, you might also get:
a high temperature
aches and pains, and generally feeling unwell
loss of appetite
Chickenpox is very itchy and can make children feel miserable, even if they do not have many spots.
The chickenpox spots look the same on children and adults. But adults usually have a high temperature for longer and more spots than children.
It's possible to get chickenpox more than once, but it's unusual.

How to treat chickenpox at home
Important:
Stay off school or work
You'll need to stay away from school, nursery or work until all the spots have formed a scab. This is usually 5 days after the spots appeared.
Do
drink plenty of fluid (try ice lollies if your child is not drinking) to avoid dehydration
take
paracetamol
to help with pain and discomfort
cut your child's fingernails and put socks on their hands at night to stop them scratching
use cooling creams or gels from a pharmacy
speak to a pharmacist about using
antihistamine medicine
to help itching
bathe in cool water and pat the skin dry (do not rub)
dress in loose clothes
Don’t
do not use
ibuprofen
unless advised to do so by a doctor, as it may cause serious skin infections
do not give aspirin to children under 16
do not go near newborn babies, people who are pregnant and people with a weakened immune system, as chickenpox can be dangerous for them
do not scratch the spots, as scratching can cause scarring

Check if you have impetigo
Impetigo starts with red sores or blisters, but the redness may be harder to see in brown and black skin.
The sores or blisters quickly burst and leave crusty, golden-brown patches.
The patches can:
look a bit like cornflakes stuck to your skin
get bigger
spread to other parts of your body
be itchy
sometimes be painful
Sores (non-bullous impetigo) or blisters (bullous impetigo) can start anywhere – but usually on exposed areas like your face and hands.

Non-urgent advice:
See a GP if you or your child:
might have impetigo
had treatment for impetigo but the symptoms change or get worse
had impetigo before and it keeps coming back
Impetigo is very infectious. Check with the GP before you go into the surgery. They may suggest a phone consultation.

Check if it's scabies
The symptoms of scabies are:
intense itching, especially at night
a raised rash or spots
The spots may look red. They are more difficult to see on dark skin, but you should be able to feel them.
Tiny mites lay eggs in the skin, leaving lines with a dot at one end.

The scabies rash usually spreads across the whole body, apart from the head.
However, older people, young children and those with a weakened immune system may develop a rash on their head and neck.

A pharmacist can help with scabies
Scabies is not usually a serious condition, but it does need to be treated.
A pharmacist will recommend a cream or lotion that you apply over your whole body. It's important to read the instructions carefully.
Let the pharmacist know if you are breastfeeding or pregnant.
You'll need to repeat the treatment 1 week later.
Scabies is very infectious, but it can take up to 8 weeks for the rash to appear.
Everyone in your home needs to be treated at the same time, even if they do not have symptoms.
Anyone you have had sexual contact with in the past 8 weeks should also be treated.

Very small spots, called milia, often appear on a baby's face when they're a few days old. Milia may appear white or yellow, depending on your baby's skin colour.
They usually go away within a few weeks and do not need treatment.

Small, firm, raised spots could be molluscum contagiosum. The spots can be the same colour as surrounding skin, darker than surrounding skin, or pink.
You can usually treat molluscum contagiosum at home.
Molluscum contagiosum symptoms and what to do
Check if it's molluscum contagiosum
Molluscum contagiosum is more common in children, but anyone can get it.
Usually, the only symptom of molluscum contagiosum is spots.
The spots are about 2 to 5mm wide and usually appear together. They are raised and dome-shaped with a shiny white dimple in the middle.

How to look after yourself or your child
The spots caused by molluscum contagiosum are usually harmless and should clear up within 18 months without needing treatment.
Molluscum contagiosum is contagious. It is usually passed on by direct skin to skin contact.
The chance of passing it on to other people during normal activities is small so you or your child should be able to carry on with your normal activities. If you are not sure, check with a GP.
There are some things you can do to help reduce the risk of the infection spreading and help ease any symptoms.
Do
try things to help with dryness and itchy skin, such as holding a damp towel against the skin, having cool baths or using an unperfumed moisturiser regularly
keep the affected area covered, including using waterproof bandages if you go swimming
use a condom while having sex if you are infected
Don’t
do not squeeze or scratch the spots, as it could cause an infection or scarring
do not share baths or things such as towels, bedding or clothes

Things you can do to help with nappy rash
Nappy rash can be treated and prevented by following some simple advice.
Do
change wet or dirty nappies as soon as possible
keep the skin clean and dry – pat or rub the skin gently to dry it
leave nappies off when possible
use extra absorbent nappies
make sure your baby's nappies fit properly
clean your baby's skin with water or fragrance-free and alcohol-free baby wipes
bath your baby daily (but not more than twice a day, as washing too much can make the skin dry out)
Don’t
do not use soaps, baby lotion or bubble bath as they can irritate the skin
do not use talcum powder or antiseptics on nappy rash
do not put nappies on too tightly as it can irritate the skin
A pharmacist can help with nappy rash
If the rash is causing your baby discomfort, a pharmacist can recommend a nappy rash cream or medicine to treat it at home.
They may suggest using a thin layer of a barrier cream to protect the skin or giving your baby
child's paracetamol
for pain relief (only suitable for babies over 2 months old).

Yellow or white, greasy, scaly patches on your baby's scalp could be cradle cap.
Cradle cap can usually be treated at home.
Cradle cap symptoms and what to do
Check if your baby has cradle cap
The main symptom of cradle cap is patches of greasy, scaly skin.
It's usually found on the scalp and face, but sometimes affects the nappy area. It can look like:
patches of white or yellow greasy scales on the scalp and face that form a crust which might flake off
small, dry flakes of skin on the nappy area
The scales look similar on all skin tones. But the skin under the scales may look pink or red if your baby has white skin, or lighter or darker than the surrounding skin if your baby has brown or black skin.
It is not itchy or painful and does not bother your baby.
The cause of cradle cap is not clear, but it cannot be caught from other babies.

Check if it's molluscum contagiosum
Molluscum contagiosum is more common in children, but anyone can get it.
Usually, the only symptom of molluscum contagiosum is spots.
The spots are about 2 to 5mm wide and usually appear together. They are raised and dome-shaped with a shiny white dimple in the middle.

How to look after yourself or your child
The spots caused by molluscum contagiosum are usually harmless and should clear up within 18 months without needing treatment.
Molluscum contagiosum is contagious. It is usually passed on by direct skin to skin contact.
The chance of passing it on to other people during normal activities is small so you or your child should be able to carry on with your normal activities. If you are not sure, check with a GP.
There are some things you can do to help reduce the risk of the infection spreading and help ease any symptoms.
Do
try things to help with dryness and itchy skin, such as holding a damp towel against the skin, having cool baths or using an unperfumed moisturiser regularly
keep the affected area covered, including using waterproof bandages if you go swimming
use a condom while having sex if you are infected
Don’t
do not squeeze or scratch the spots, as it could cause an infection or scarring
do not share baths or things such as towels, bedding or clothes

Check if your baby has nappy rash
Symptoms of nappy rash can include:
red or raw patches on your baby’s bottom or the whole nappy area
skin that looks sore and feels hot to touch
scaly and dry skin
an itchy or painful bottom
your baby seeming uncomfortable or distressed
spots, pimples, or blisters on bottom (spots can appear red or brown, but may be less noticeable on brown and black skin)

Things you can do to help with nappy rash
Nappy rash can be treated and prevented by following some simple advice.
Do
change wet or dirty nappies as soon as possible
keep the skin clean and dry – pat or rub the skin gently to dry it
leave nappies off when possible
use extra absorbent nappies
make sure your baby's nappies fit properly
clean your baby's skin with water or fragrance-free and alcohol-free baby wipes
bath your baby daily (but not more than twice a day, as washing too much can make the skin dry out)
Don’t
do not use soaps, baby lotion or bubble bath as they can irritate the skin
do not use talcum powder or antiseptics on nappy rash
do not put nappies on too tightly as it can irritate the skin
A pharmacist can help with nappy rash
If the rash is causing your baby discomfort, a pharmacist can recommend a nappy rash cream or medicine to treat it at home.
They may suggest using a thin layer of a barrier cream to protect the skin or giving your baby
child's paracetamol
for pain relief (only suitable for babies over 2 months old).

Check if your baby has cradle cap
The main symptom of cradle cap is patches of greasy, scaly skin.
It's usually found on the scalp and face, but sometimes affects the nappy area. It can look like:
patches of white or yellow greasy scales on the scalp and face that form a crust which might flake off
small, dry flakes of skin on the nappy area
The scales look similar on all skin tones. But the skin under the scales may look pink or red if your baby has white skin, or lighter or darker than the surrounding skin if your baby has brown or black skin.
It is not itchy or painful and does not bother your baby.
The cause of cradle cap is not clear, but it cannot be caught from other babies.
