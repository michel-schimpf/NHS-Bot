use insoles or heel pads in your shoes
try regular gentle stretching exercises
try exercises that do not put pressure on your feet, such as swimming

What we mean by severe pain
Severe pain:
always there and so bad it's hard to think or talk
you cannot sleep
it's very hard to move, get out of bed, go to the bathroom, wash or dress
Moderate pain:
always there
makes it hard to concentrate or sleep
you can manage to get up, wash or dress
Mild pain:
comes and goes
is annoying but does not stop you doing daily activities

Treatment for plantar fasciitis from a foot specialist
If plantar fasciitis does not get better, a GP might refer you to a physiotherapist or foot specialist (podiatrist).
A physiotherapist can show you exercises to help ease your symptoms. A podiatrist can recommend things like insoles and the right shoes to wear.
Physiotherapy is available free of charge on the NHS throughout the UK but waiting times can sometimes be long.
Depending on where you live, you may be able to self-refer or you may need to visit a GP or consultant first.
Podiatry may not be available for free on the NHS everywhere and waiting times can sometimes be long.
You can also pay to see a podiatrist or physiotherapist privately.

Common causes of plantar fasciitis
Plantar fasciitis is caused by straining the part of your foot that connects your heel bone to your toes (plantar fascia).
It's not always clear why this happens.
You may be more likely to get plantar fasciitis if you:
are 40 to 60 years of age
recently started exercising on hard surfaces
exercise with a tight calf or heel
overstretch the sole of your foot during exercise
recently started doing a lot more walking, running or standing up
wear shoes with poor cushioning or support
are very overweight
