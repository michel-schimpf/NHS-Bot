Croup is a common condition that mainly affects babies' and young children's airways. It's usually mild, but it's important to call NHS 111 if you think your child has croup as they may need treatment.

Check if your child has croup
Symptoms of croup include:
a barking cough – this may sound like a seal (you can search online to hear examples)
a hoarse voice
difficulty breathing
a high pitched, rasping sound when breathing in
Your child will usually have cold-like symptoms to begin with, such as a temperature, runny nose and cough.
Croup symptoms usually come on after a few days and are often worse at night.

How to look after a child with croup at home
Croup usually gets better on its own within 48 hours. There are things you can do to help.
Do
sit your child upright and try not to let them lie down
comfort them if they're distressed and try to keep them calm (crying can make the symptoms worse)
give them plenty of fluids
check on them regularly, including at night
give them
paracetamol
or
ibuprofen
to help ease a high temperature or any discomfort
Don’t
do not put your child in a steamy room or get them to inhale steam

Immediate action required:
Call 999 or go to A&E if your child:
is struggling to breathe (you may notice grunting noises, see their tummy sucking under their ribcage, or their breathing may sound different)
has blue, grey, pale or blotchy skin, lips or tongue – on brown or black skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of the hands or soles of the feet
is sleepier than normal or difficult to wake
is unusually quiet and still
is limp, floppy or not responding like they normally do (their head may fall to the side, backwards or forwards, or they may find it difficult to lift their head or focus on your face)
is very upset or restless, is having difficulty breathing and can't be calmed down
is unwell and drooling more than they normally do, finding it hard to swallow, or wants to sit rather than lie down
