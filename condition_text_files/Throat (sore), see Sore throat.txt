Sore throats are very common and usually nothing to worry about. They normally get better by themselves within a week.

How to treat a sore throat yourself
To help soothe a sore throat and shorten how long it lasts, you can:
gargle with warm, salty water (children should not try this)
drink plenty of water
eat cool or soft foods
avoid smoking or smoky places
suck ice cubes, ice lollies or hard sweets – but do not give young children anything small and hard to suck because of the risk of choking
rest
How to gargle with salt water
Dissolve half a teaspoon of salt in a glass of warm water (warm water helps salt dissolve).
Gargle with the solution, then spit it out (do not swallow it).
Repeat as often as you like.

A pharmacist can help with sore throats
You can ask a pharmacist about ways of relieving the pain and discomfort of a sore throat, such as:
paracetamol
or
ibuprofen
medicated lozenges containing a local anaesthetic, antiseptic, or anti-inflammatory medicine
anaesthetic spray (although there's little proof they help)
You can buy these treatments from a supermarket or from a pharmacist without a prescription.

Antibiotics
You do not normally need antibiotics for a sore throat because they will not usually relieve your symptoms or speed up your recovery.
They'll only be prescribed if a GP thinks you could have a bacterial infection.

Non-urgent advice:
See a GP if:
your sore throat does not improve after a week
you often get sore throats
A severe or long-lasting sore throat could be something like strep throat (a bacterial throat infection).
Urgent advice:
Get advice from 111 now if:
you're worried about your sore throat
you have a sore throat and a very high temperature, or you feel hot and shivery
you have a weakened immune system – for example, because of diabetes or chemotherapy
