Costochondritis is inflammation where your ribs join the bone in the middle of your chest (breastbone). It can cause sharp chest pain, especially when moving or breathing. It usually gets better on its own over time.

Treatments for costochondritis

Painkillers that help with inflammation, like
ibuprofen
, may be recommended to help with the pain.
If you have very bad pain that does not get better over time, you may be offered a
steroid injection
to help reduce inflammation or
local anaesthetic
to ease the pain.

Causes of costochondritis
It is not always known what causes costochondritis, but it may be caused by:
an injury to your chest
repetitive upper body movements, like lifting
coughing a lot
Sometimes it may be caused by a problem with the joints in the back, or another underlying condition like
fibromyalgia
or
rheumatoid arthritis
.
It can also be caused by an infection.
