pregnancy and having a baby â€“ your hormone levels change when you're pregnant, and looking after a baby can be stressful and tiring
lower hormone levels as you get older, particularly during the
menopause
taking certain medicines, such as medicine for
high blood pressure
or
antidepressants
using hormonal
contraception
like the pill, patch or implant
drinking too much alcohol
Some long-term conditions can also affect your sex drive, such as
heart disease
,
diabetes
, an
underactive thyroid
or
cancer
.

Non-urgent advice:
