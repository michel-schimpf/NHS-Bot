There are many causes of wrist pain. You can often ease the pain yourself. But see a GP if the pain does not improve.

How you can ease wrist pain yourself
If you see a GP about pain in your wrist, they'll usually suggest you try these things:
Do
rest your wrist when you can
put an ice pack (or a bag of frozen peas) in a towel and place it on your wrist for up to 20 minutes every 2 to 3 hours
keep your hands and wrists moving with gentle exercises to help ease pain and stiffness
take paracetamol to ease the pain
take off any jewellery if your hand looks swollen
stop or cut down activities that are causing the pain – for example, typing, using vibrating tools for work, or playing an instrument
wear a splint to support your wrist and ease pain, especially at night – you can get these at most pharmacies and supermarkets
think about using gadgets or tools to make difficult or painful tasks easier – for example, to open jars or chop vegetables
think about getting a soft pad to support your wrist when typing
Don’t
do not use ibuprofen in the first 48 hours after an injury
do not use heat packs or have hot baths for the first 2 to 3 days after an injury
do not lift heavy objects or grip anything too tightly
