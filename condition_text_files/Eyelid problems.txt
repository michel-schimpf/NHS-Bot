Find out what to do if you have a lump on your eyelid, or an eyelid that's swollen, sticky, itchy or painful.

Most eyelid problems are harmless
Many eyelid problems are not serious.
It's fairly common to have any of these problems:
a lump that goes away by itself after 3 or 4 weeks
mildly itchy, flaky or sticky eyelids that clear up by themselves
swelling from a nearby insect bite, injury or operation that goes away after a week or so
twitching or blinking from time to time – often when you're tired
eyelids that droop (or get more "hooded") as you get older

Types of eyelid problems
Your symptoms might give you an idea of what's causing your eyelid problem. But do not self-diagnose – see a GP if you're worried.
