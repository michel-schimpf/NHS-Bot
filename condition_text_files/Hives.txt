your lips, mouth, throat or tongue suddenly become swollen
you're breathing very fast or struggling to breathe (you may become very wheezy or feel like you're choking or gasping for air)
your throat feels tight or you're struggling to swallow

You cannot always prevent hives
You get hives when something causes high levels of histamine and other chemicals to be released in your skin. This is known as a trigger.
Triggers can include:
eating certain foods
contact with certain plants, animals, chemicals and latex
cold, such as cold water or wind
hot, sweaty skin from exercise, emotional stress or eating spicy food
a reaction to a medicine, insect bite or sting
scratching or pressing on your skin, such as wearing itchy or tight clothing
an infection
a problem with your immune system
water or sunlight, but this is rare
Try to find out what triggers hives for you, so you can avoid those triggers, if possible. This may help prevent an episode of hives.
