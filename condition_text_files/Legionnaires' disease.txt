Legionnaires' disease is a lung infection you can get from inhaling droplets of water from things like air conditioning or hot tubs. It's uncommon but it can be very serious.

How you get Legionnaires' disease
You can get Legionnaires' disease if you breathe in tiny droplets of water containing bacteria that cause the infection.
It's usually caught in places like hotels, hospitals or offices where the bacteria have got into the water supply. It's less common to catch it at home.
You can get Legionnaires' disease from things like:
air conditioning systems
humidifiers
spa pools and hot tubs
taps and showers that are not used often
You cannot usually get it from:
drinking water that contains the bacteria
other people with the infection
places like ponds, lakes and rivers

Check if you have Legionnaires' disease
Symptoms of Legionnaires' disease include:
a cough
shortness of breath
chest pain or discomfort, particularly when breathing or coughing
a high temperature
flu-like symptoms

Urgent advice:
Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if:
You have symptoms of Legionnaires' disease such as:
a cough that's lasted 3 weeks or more
coughing up blood
chest pain that comes and goes, or happens when breathing or coughing

Treatment for Legionnaires' disease
You may need to go into hospital if you're diagnosed with Legionnaires' disease.
Treatment in hospital may include:
antibiotics given directly into a vein
oxygen through a face mask or tubes in your nose
a machine to help you breathe
When you start to get better you might be able to take antibiotic tablets at home. Antibiotic treatment usually lasts 1 to 3 weeks.
Most people make a full recovery, but it might take a few weeks to feel back to normal.
