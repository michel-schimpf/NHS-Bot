There are several ways you can get your hearing tested.

How to get an NHS hearing test
You can get a free hearing test on the NHS. A GP may refer you to a hearing specialist (audiologist) who can do the test.
It could take a few weeks to see a specialist so it might be quicker to get tested somewhere else, like at a large pharmacy or opticians. This is often free.
Important
Always see a GP first if:
you also have other symptoms, like earache or discharge â€“ this could be something easily treatable like an
earwax build-up
or
ear infection
you have sudden hearing loss in one ear
you're worried about your child's hearing
