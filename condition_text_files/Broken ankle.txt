Severe pain:
always there and so bad it's hard to think or talk
you cannot sleep
it's very hard to move, get out of bed, go to the bathroom, wash or dress
Moderate pain:
always there
makes it hard to concentrate or sleep
you can manage to get up, wash or dress
Mild pain:
comes and goes
is annoying but does not stop you doing daily activities

While you're waiting to see a doctor
If you think you've broken your ankle, there are some things you can do while you're waiting to see a doctor.
You should:
raise your ankle if possible
gently hold an ice pack (or a bag of frozen peas) wrapped in a towel on your ankle for 15 to 20 minutes every 2 to 3 hours
stop any bleeding – put pressure on the wound using a clean cloth or dressing
wrap your ankle loosely in a bandage to help support it (if your ankle is not at an odd angle)
remove any jewellery on your ankle or toes
use painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen gel (or ibuprofen tablets if needed)
not eat or drink anything in case you need surgery
not move or put weight on your ankle if possible

Treatments for a broken ankle
You'll usually have an X-ray to check if your ankle is broken and see how bad the break is.
If you have a very minor break, you may not need any treatment.
For a more serious break, you may need:
a special boot to help support your ankle
a plaster cast to hold your ankle in place while it heals
the bones to be moved back into place by a doctor (they'll give you an injection to numb your ankle)
surgery to fix the broken bones
You'll usually have follow-up appointments to check your ankle is healing properly.

Recovering from a broken ankle
A broken ankle usually takes 6 to 8 weeks to heal, but it can take longer.
The doctor will tell you:
how long you'll have to wear the boot or have the plaster cast on
how much weight to put on your ankle – you may be given crutches or a walking frame to help keep weight off it
Once it's healed, use your ankle as normal. Moving it will stop it getting stiff.
You may need to see a physiotherapist. They can help you with exercises to get your foot and ankle gently moving again.
Ask your doctor when you can return to contact sports or other activities that put a lot of strain on your ankle.

gently move your toes and bend your knee while wearing the boot or cast to ease stiff muscles
