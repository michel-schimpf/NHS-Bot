Dupuytren's contracture is when 1 or more fingers bend in towards your palm. There's no cure, but your fingers can be straightened if it's severe.

Check if you have Dupuytren's contracture
Dupuytren's contracture mainly affects the ring and little fingers. You can have it in both hands at the same time.
It tends to get slowly worse over many months or years. Treatment cannot usually help in the early stages.

It starts with lumps, dimples or ridges on your palm.

Treatments for Dupuytren's contracture
Speak to a specialist about the options, what the benefits and risks are, and what to expect afterwards.
Your finger may not be completely straight after treatment, and might not be as strong and flexible as it used to be.
The contracture could also come back after a few years.
There are 3 main types of treatment.
Surgery to straighten the fingers
Fasciectomy
A cut is made along your palm and finger so the surgeon can straighten it.
general anaesthetic (you're asleep) or local anaesthetic (your hand is numbed)
you can leave hospital the same day
recovery time: 4 to 12 weeks
lowest risk of contracture coming back
risks include bleeding, numbness and infection
Using a needle to straighten the fingers
Needle fasciotomy
A needle is inserted into several places along your palm and finger to loosen and straighten it.
local anaesthetic (your hand is numbed)
you can leave hospital the same day
recovery time: up to 2 weeks
contracture more likely to come back than with surgery
risks include a cut opening up in your skin, pain and numbness
Using surgery and a skin graft to straighten the fingers
Dermafasciectomy
Similar to a fasciectomy, except an additional area of skin is removed; a skin graft from elsewhere in the body can be used to replace the removed skin.
general anaesthetic (you're asleep) or local anaesthetic (your hand is numbed)
2 procedures are needed â€“ 1 to straighten the fingers and then around 4 days later, another procedure to add the skin graft
contractures less likely to come back than with a standard fasciectomy but recovery times can be longer
risks include bleeding, numbness and infection

Causes and preventing Dupuytren's contracture
Dupuytren's contracture happens when the tissue under the skin near your fingers becomes thicker and less flexible.
The exact cause is unknown, but it's been linked to:
having a family history of the condition
smoking
drinking lots of alcohol
having diabetes or epilepsy
It's not known if you can prevent it or stop it coming back.
