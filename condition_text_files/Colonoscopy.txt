A colonoscopy is a test to check inside your bowels.
This test can help find what's causing your bowel symptoms.
A long, thin, flexible tube with a small camera inside it is passed into your bottom.
You'll be given a laxative so your bowels are empty for the test.
Important
You're usually awake during a colonoscopy. You'll be offered medicine to make you more comfortable and make the test easier.
