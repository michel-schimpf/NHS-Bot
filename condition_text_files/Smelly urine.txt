Smelly pee on its own is not usually a cause for concern. There are often things you can do to help your pee return to normal.

Common causes of smelly pee
Pee is usually clear or pale yellow, with a mild smell.
Things that can often make your pee smell stronger include:
certain types of food and drink, like asparagus or coffee
not drinking enough fluids (
dehydration
)
some medicines
vitamin B6 supplements
If you have other symptoms such as pain when peeing, peeing more often than usual and pee that looks cloudy, you may have a
urinary tract infection (UTI)
.
Less often, smelly pee can be caused by other conditions such as
type 2 diabetes
or
kidney stones
.

Things you can do if you have smelly pee
