Astigmatism, along with short-sightedness and long-sightedness, is a common cause of blurry vision. It's usually corrected with glasses or contact lenses.

What is astigmatism?
Astigmatism means your eye is shaped more like a rugby ball than a football, so light is focused at more than 1 place in the eye.
This can cause:
blurred vision
headaches
eye strain (you may notice this after concentrating for a long time â€“ on a computer, for example)
Astigmatism normally happens alongside
short-sightedness
or
long-sightedness
.
Astigmatism in 1 eye may cause
lazy eye
(where the vision does not develop properly). It's important this is spotted early so it can be treated.
Important:
Regular eye tests for children
Take your child for
regular eye tests
. Astigmatism, as well as short-sightedness or long-sightedness, may affect their reading or concentration.
Find an optician
Teenagers with astigmatism should also have regular eye tests to check for an eye condition called keratoconus. This causes the cornea to change shape.
