A small amount of one-off bleeding from the bottom is not usually a serious problem. But a GP can check.

Check if you're bleeding from the bottom
You might be bleeding from the bottom if you have:
blood on your toilet paper
red streaks on the outside of your poo
pink water in the toilet bowl
blood in your poo or bloody diarrhoea
very dark poo (this can be blood mixed in poo)
A small amount of one-off bleeding can often go away on its own without needing treatment.

Non-urgent advice:
See a GP if:
your child has blood in their poo
you've had blood in your poo for 3 weeks
your poo has been softer, thinner or longer than normal for 3 weeks
you're in a lot of pain around the bottom
you have a pain or lump in your tummy
you've been more tired than usual
you've lost weight for no reason

Urgent advice:
Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if:
your poo is black or dark red
you have bloody diarrhoea
You can call 111 or
get help from 111 online
.

Immediate action required:
Go to A&E or call 999 if:
you're bleeding non-stop
there's a lot of blood – for example, the toilet water turns red or you see large blood clots
Find your nearest A&E

What happens at the GP appointment
If you have bleeding from your bottom, a GP will check what's causing it.
They might:
check your bottom (rectum) with a gloved finger (
rectal examination
)
ask for a sample of poo for testing
refer you to a specialist for tests
Important:
Bowel cancer risk
Bleeding from the bottom is sometimes a sign of bowel cancer.
This is easier to treat if it's found early, so it's important to get it checked.
