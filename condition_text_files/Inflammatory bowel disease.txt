Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a term used to describe conditions that cause severe tummy pain and diarrhoea. IBD is long-term, but there are treatments that can help with the symptoms.
The main types of IBD are
Crohn's disease
and
ulcerative colitis
.
Information:
IBD is different to
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
, even though some of the symptoms may be similar.

diarrhoea that lasts longer than 4 weeks
tummy pain
blood or mucus (clear slime) in your poo

Treatment for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
Treatment for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) will depend on your symptoms. If you're very unwell, you may need to be treated in hospital.
Treatments may include:
medicines to help ease your symptoms, such as
steroids
, and other medicines that can help keep your symptoms under control
surgery to remove part of your bowel, if your symptoms are severe

Causes of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
It's not clear what causes inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It happens when your immune system attacks your bowel, which causes it to get inflamed.
You're more likely to get IBD if one of your close relatives has it, for example, one of your parents, grandparents, or a sibling.
