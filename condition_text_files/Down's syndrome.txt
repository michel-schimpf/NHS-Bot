Down's syndrome is when you're born with an extra chromosome.
You usually get an extra chromosome by chance, because of a change in the sperm or egg before you're born.
This change does not happen because of anything anyone did before or during pregnancy.

What it's like to have Down's syndrome

learning disability
. This means they'll have a range of abilities.
Some people will be more independent and do things like get a job. Other people might need more regular care.

their own personalities
things they like and dislike

Screening

12-week scan
.
If you have a higher chance, you can have further tests.
Important
It's your choice whether or not to have any screening tests.
