Diabetic eye screening is a test to check for eye problems caused by diabetes.
Eye problems caused by diabetes are called
diabetic retinopathy
. This can lead to sight loss if it's not found early.
The eye screening test can find problems before they affect your sight.
Pictures are taken of the back of your eyes to check for any changes.
If you have diabetes and you're aged 12 or over, you'll get a letter asking you to have your eyes checked every 1 or 2 years.
How often you're invited depends on the results from your last 2 screening tests.
