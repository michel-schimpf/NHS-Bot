A lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) test measures the amount of LDH in the blood.
Lactate dehydrogenase is an enzyme that the body uses during the process of turning sugar into energy for your cells to use.
LDH is found in many of the body's tissues and organs, including the muscles, liver, heart, pancreas, kidneys, brain and blood cells.
The LDH test is mainly used to help identify the location and severity of tissue damage in the body.
It's also sometimes used to monitor how far certain conditions have progressed.
These include:
kidney disease
liver disease
some types of
cancer
In the past, LDH levels were also used to help diagnose and monitor
heart attacks
. But other tests are now usually used to do this.
