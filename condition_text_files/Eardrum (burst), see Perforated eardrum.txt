a ringing or buzzing sound in your ear (
tinnitus
)

Treatment for a perforated eardrum
A perforated eardrum usually gets better on its own within 2 months and your hearing returns to normal.
A GP may prescribe antibiotics if you have an ear infection, or to stop you getting an ear infection while your eardrum heals.
Sometimes, surgery to repair the eardrum (myringoplasty) may be needed if the eardrum is not healing by itself.
Important
Go back to your GP if your symptoms have not started to improve after a few weeks.

Things you can do if you have a perforated eardrum
There are some things you can do to help heal a perforated eardrum and ease symptoms.
Do
take painkillers like
paracetamol
or
ibuprofen
to ease any pain
put a large piece of cotton wool covered in petroleum jelly in your outer ear when you wash your hair to stop water getting in
Don’t
do not go swimming or get your ear wet until your eardrum heals
do not put anything inside your ear, such as cotton buds or eardrops (unless a doctor recommends them)
try not to blow your nose too hard because this can damage your eardrum as it heals
Information:
Flying with a perforated eardrum
It's safe to fly if you have a perforated eardrum. But if you've had surgery to repair a perforated eardrum (myringoplasty), do not fly until you're told it's safe to.
