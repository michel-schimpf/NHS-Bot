A phosphate test is used to measure the level of phosphate in the blood.
Phosphate is a chemical that contains the
mineral phosphorus
. Phosphates are essential for the production of energy, muscle and nerve function, and bone growth.
Phosphate tests are very useful for measuring phosphate levels in people with
malnutrition
(where their diet doesn't contain the right amount of nutrients to meet their body's demands).
A phosphate test can also be used to check for a condition called
ketoacidosis
, which sometimes affects people with
diabetes
.
If you have ketoacidosis, your body can't use blood glucose as an energy source because of a lack of insulin (a hormone that controls blood sugar levels).
Phosphate tests can also be used to help diagnose digestive system conditions that interfere with the absorption of phosphate, calcium and magnesium.
Phosphate levels need to be carefully monitored in people with
chronic kidney disease
.
