A colposcopy is a test to take a closer look at your cervix. The cervix is the opening to your womb from your vagina.
A colposcopy is often done if cervical screening finds changes to your cells that are caused by certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV). These changed cells can turn into cervical cancer cells.
During a colposcopy a smooth, tube-shaped tool (a speculum) is gently placed into your vagina to open it. A microscope is then used to look at your cervix in greater detail. The microscope stays outside your body.
A small sample of cells may be taken from your cervix for testing. This is called a biopsy.
