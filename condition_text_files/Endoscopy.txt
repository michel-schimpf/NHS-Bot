An endoscopy is a test to look inside your body.
A long, thin tube with a small camera inside, called an endoscope, is passed into your body through a natural opening such as your mouth.
Your GP may refer you for an endoscopy if you're having certain symptoms. It will usually be done at an endoscopy unit in a hospital.
There are different types of endoscopy that look at different parts of the body.
The type of endoscopy you have will depend on your symptoms.
