Morton's neuroma is where there's a thickening of tissue around a nerve in your foot that's been irritated or damaged. The symptoms can often be eased with treatments you can try yourself.

The main symptoms of Morton's neuroma include:
a shooting, stabbing or burning pain
feeling like a pebble or lump is stuck under your foot
Some people may also have tingling or numbness in their foot.
The symptoms may be worse when you move your foot or wear tight or high-heeled shoes. It often gets worse over time.

How you can ease the pain yourself
If you go to a GP, they'll usually suggest you try these things first:
Do
rest and raise your foot when you can
hold an ice pack (or bag of frozen peas) in a towel on the painful area for up to 20 minutes every few hours
take ibuprofen or paracetamol
wear wide, comfortable shoes with a low heel and soft sole
use soft insoles or pads you put in your shoes
try to lose weight if you're overweight
avoid or reduce impact activities such as running and jumping
Don’t
do not wear tight, pointy shoes, high heels, or shoes with thin soles
You can ask a pharmacist about:
the best painkiller to take
soft pads or insoles for your shoes – ask for metatarsal pads
Find a pharmacy

Non-urgent advice:
See a GP if:
the pain is severe or stopping you doing your normal activities
the pain is getting worse or keeps coming back
the pain has not improved after treating it yourself for 2 weeks
you have any tingling or numbness in your foot
you have diabetes – foot problems can be more serious if you have diabetes
What we mean by severe pain
Severe pain:
always there and so bad it's hard to think or talk
you cannot sleep
it's very hard to move, get out of bed, go to the bathroom, wash or dress
Moderate pain:
always there
makes it hard to concentrate or sleep
you can manage to get up, wash or dress
Mild pain:
comes and goes
is annoying but does not stop you doing daily activities

Treatment for Morton's neuroma
A GP can:
look at your foot to see if it's Morton's neuroma
refer you to a foot specialist if they think you need further treatment
Treatment from a foot specialist
Treatments from a foot specialist, such as a podiatrist or foot and ankle surgeon, may include:
specially made soft pads or insoles – to take pressure off the painful area of your foot
non-surgical treatments – such as using heat to treat the nerve (radiofrequency ablation)
steroid or alcohol injections, or foot surgery – if you have very severe symptoms or other treatments are not working
Referral to a podiatrist on the NHS may not be available to everyone and waiting times can be long.
You can pay to see a podiatrist privately.

flat feet
, high arches,
bunions
or
