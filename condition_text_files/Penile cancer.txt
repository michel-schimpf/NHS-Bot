Penile cancer is a rare cancer that mostly affects the skin of the penis and the foreskin (the skin covering the head of the penis). It's most common in men over 50.
Anyone with a penis can get penile cancer.
Treatment for most penile cancers caught very early include creams and laser therapy.
If not caught early, treatment may mean surgery.

Important:
Get your symptoms checked
It's important to get any
symptoms of penile cancer
checked as soon as possible.
Finding cancer early can make it more treatable.
