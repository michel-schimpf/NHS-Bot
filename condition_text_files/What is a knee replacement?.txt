Knee replacement surgery involves replacing damaged parts of your knee joint with metal or plastic parts.
It's most commonly used to treat pain and stiffness in the knee joint caused by osteoarthritis.
It may be recommended if other treatments or lifestyle changes have not worked and knee pain is affecting your daily life.
Depending on the damage to your knee, it can be used to replace all of your knee joint (total knee replacement) or some of it (partial knee replacement).
You'll have the operation in hospital. It can take several months or more to fully recover afterwards.
Knee replacements can last for 20 years or more and can significantly improve daily life for people with knee pain.
