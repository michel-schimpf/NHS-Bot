Common causes of a sore or white tongue
Biting or burning your tongue with hot food or drink can cause pain and swelling. This should only last a few days.
A white tongue can be a sign of a health condition, such as anaemia, scarlet fever, lichen planus, leukoplakia, geographic tongue, mouth ulcers or oral thrush.
But do not self-diagnose. See a GP if you're worried.
