A gastroscopy is a test to check inside your throat, food pipe (oesophagus) and stomach, known as the upper part of your digestive system.
This test can help find what's causing your symptoms.
A long, thin, flexible tube with a small camera inside it is passed into your mouth then down your throat and into your stomach.
A gastroscopy can also be used to remove tissue for testing (
biopsy
) and treat some conditions such as stomach ulcers.

Important:
Your pain relief options
