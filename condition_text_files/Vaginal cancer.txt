Vaginal cancer is a very rare cancer that's found anywhere in the vagina. It's most common in women aged 75 and over.
Anyone with a vagina can get vaginal cancer.
The vagina is a tube between the vulva and the opening of the womb (cervix).
Vaginal cancer is nearly always caused by an infection from certain types of the human papillomavirus (HPV).
It's often found and prevented by attending cervical screening, which aims to find and treat abnormalities before they turn into cancer.
Vaginal cancer usually grows very slowly and how serious it is depends on how big it is, if it has spread and your general health.

Important:
