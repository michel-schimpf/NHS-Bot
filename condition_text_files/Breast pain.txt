There are many reasons breasts can be painful. It's not usually anything serious, but see a GP if the pain does not improve.

Causes of breast pain
Breast pain is usually linked to periods. Sometimes it can be caused by a health condition or medicine.
Breast pain linked to periods
Breast pain linked to periods usually:
begins up to 2 weeks before a period, gets worse and then goes away when the period ends
feels dull, heavy or aching
affects both breasts and sometimes spreads to the armpit
Other causes of breast pain
Other causes of breast pain include:
injuries or
sprains
to the neck, shoulder or back – these can be felt as breast pain
medicines like the contraceptive pill and some antidepressants
conditions like
mastitis
or a
breast abscess
pregnancy
hormone changes during the
menopause
Breast pain by itself is unlikely to be a symptom of cancer.

Things you can do to ease breast pain
To help ease breast pain:
take
paracetamol
or
ibuprofen
, or rub painkilling gel on your breasts
wear a properly fitted bra during the day and a soft bra to sleep in
There's little evidence that vitamin E tablets or evening primrose oil help with breast pain.

Non-urgent advice:
See a GP about breast pain if:
it's not improving or painkillers are not helping
there's a history of breast cancer in your family
you have any
signs of pregnancy
– you could do a
pregnancy test
first
