Causes of smelly feet
The main causes of smelly feet are a build-up of sweat and bacteria on them and fungal infections like
athlete's foot
.
The amount you sweat can be affected by:
hot weather
exercise
standing all day
being overweight
hormonal changes, which happen during puberty, menopause and pregnancy
some medicines, such as antidepressants
a condition that causes excessive sweating called
hyperhidrosis

Non-urgent advice:
See a GP if:
your smelly feet have not got better after treating them yourself
your smelly feet are affecting your daily life

Medical treatments for smelly feet
Treatment for smelly feet depends on the cause.
If your smelly feet are caused by a fungal infection, a GP might prescribe a stronger antifungal treatment to clear it up.
If the cause is sweating, they might suggest a stronger antiperspirant or treatment to reduce sweating.
A treatment called iontophoresis may help with sweating, which involves passing a weak electrical current through the affected areas.
A GP might also suggest you see a foot specialist (podiatrist) if your footcare problems do not clear up quickly.
