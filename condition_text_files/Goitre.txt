Treatments for a goitre
Most goitres are small and do not cause any problems. Sometimes they do not need treatment.
You will usually need tests like blood tests and sometimes an ultrasound scan to find out what is causing your goitre.
If it is caused by a health condition like an underactive or overactive thyroid, it can usually be treated with medicines.
If your goitre is making breathing and swallowing difficult, you may have surgery to remove some or all of your thyroid.
