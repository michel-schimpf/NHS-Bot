Alcohol poisoning can happen when you drink alcohol quicker than your body can process it. It can make you seriously ill and you may need to go to hospital for treatment.

Things you can do to help someone who has drunk too much alcohol
Do
stay with them because there's a risk they could choke on their own sick or stop breathing
sit them up if they're awake, or put them in the
recovery position
if they've passed out and check they're breathing properly
give them water to sip if they're able to swallow
keep them warm with a jacket or blanket
Donâ€™t
do not let them drink more alcohol
do not give them coffee or drinks containing caffeine because this can dehydrate people with alcohol poisoning
do not put them in a cold shower or bath because there's a risk they could get too cold, fall or lose consciousness in the water
do not try to make them sick

Treatment for alcohol poisoning
You'll need to go to hospital to be monitored if you have alcohol poisoning. It can cause serious complications, like liver and heart failure, which can be fatal.
You may be given fluids, which may be given into your veins with a drip. You may also be given help with your breathing until the effects of the alcohol wear off.

Causes of alcohol poisoning
Alcohol poisoning is usually caused by binge drinking, which is where you have a lot of alcohol in one drinking session. It can happen when you drink alcohol faster than your body can filter it out of your blood.
Having too much alcohol in your blood stops your body working properly and can be life-threatening.
Alcohol affects people differently. Some people may be able to drink more alcohol than others, with fewer effects.
