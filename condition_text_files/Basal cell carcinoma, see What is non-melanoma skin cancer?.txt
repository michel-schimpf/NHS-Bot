Non-melanoma skin cancer is a common type of cancer that starts in the top layer of skin.
The main types are basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).
Non-melanoma skin cancer can often be easily treated.
The main cause is ultraviolet light, which comes from the sun and is used in sunbeds.
