It's normal to sometimes feel thirsty, but it's not normal to constantly feel thirsty even when you're drinking a lot. See a GP to find out what's causing your excessive thirst.

Why am I always thirsty?
Most of the time if you're feeling thirsty it's because you need to drink more fluids.
This can happen if you:
sweat a lot after doing exercise
are unwell with sickness and diarrhoea
do not drink enough fluids
drink too much alcohol or caffeine
eat salty or spicy food
have a high temperature
are pregnant

Important
Drink more fluids and avoid alcohol or caffeine to see if it helps. If you do not, you may be at risk of becoming dehydrated.
Check if you're dehydrated
Symptoms of dehydration in adults and children include:
feeling thirsty
dark yellow and strong-smelling pee
peeing little and less than 4 times a day
feeling dizzy or lightheaded
feeling tired
dry mouth, lips and eyes

Non-urgent advice:
See a GP if you have excessive thirst and:
drinking more fluids for several days has not helped
you frequently need to pee
you're pregnant
The GP will check if your excessive thirst is being caused by something â€“ for example,
diabetes
,
anaemia
or medicines you're taking.
The treatment you have will depend on what's causing your excessive thirst.

Dry mouth or excessive thirst?
You may think you're thirsty when you actually have a dry mouth.
If it's a dry mouth, you may have:
a burning sensation or soreness in your mouth
changes in your sense of taste
difficulty speaking, eating or swallowing
